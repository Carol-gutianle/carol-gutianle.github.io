Hi! I am Tianle (Carol) Gu, a second-year master's student in Electronic Information at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Yujiu Yang. Before this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology from Hunan University. I have also interned twice at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, working under the guidance of Dr. Hang Yan and Dr. Yan Teng. My current research interests primarily focus on (Multimodal) LLM Safety and LLM Alignment.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Additionally, I am currently seeking a 26fall PhD position.
